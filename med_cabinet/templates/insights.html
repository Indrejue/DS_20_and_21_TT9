      <h2>Scrubbing Data according to the Objective</h2>
      <p> We want to generate weed strain recommendations based on quantifiable preferences- 
      which was surprisingly difficult to find. There were only a handful of datasets that were 
      appropriate for our objective- we selected  product and strain descriptors from KushyApp 
      (https://github.com/kushyapp/cannabis-dataset/tree/master/Dataset) and we selected our 
      ratings from Kaggle user kingburrito666 (https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/cannabis-strains). 
      It was necessary to incorporate some sort of demand metric since the KushyApp data only 
      had descriptive variables and did not have any data that reflected desirability of the consumer. </p>
      <h3>Our Predictive Model </h3>
      <p> InputsoCategory what type of substance is preferred? Liquid? Vape? Edible? Smoking?
      oAilmentswhat physical/mental symptoms does the consumer want to address?
      oDesired Effectwhat should the consumer expect to feel after consumption?
      oFlavor
      Outputso5 recommendations with Brand and Product Name</p>
      <h3>Natural Language Processing </h3>
      <p>We did some rudimentary topic modeling- we parsed the descriptions in category, ailment, flavor, 
      and effects into individual columns in order to be effectively used in our predictive model. 
      Because most of the variables describing each product were categorical, k-nearest neighbors 
      seemed like the best option for our topic modeling.</p>
